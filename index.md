## Abstract

Question-answering through highlighting has limited direct applications in the real world, while question-entailment has direct applications such as producing a medical FAQ with a good database of question/answer pairs and a retrieval algorithm. For this project, question-entailment is defined as whether a hypothesis sentence is true given a premise sentence. We want to optimize cross-lingual performance, paying particular attention to low-resource languages. We also want to see if cosine-similarity is a good proxy for entailment due to it's low cost. 

Ultimately, we found that cosine-similarity was ineffective as a proxy for entailment despite it's speed. Our accuracy with cosine-similarity was better than random guessing, but it was significantly below the baseline for entailment established by traditional approaches.

## Methodology
We first fed each premise in a dataset of premise-hypothesis sentence pairs into the XLM-RoBERTa model, extracted the last layer features, and hashed each feature vector into buckets with locality sensitive hashing. Following that, for each hypothesis sentence, we generated a feature vector and compared it with other premise feature vectors in the same bucket via cosine similarity. From that comparison, we generated top 1, top 5, and top 10 rankings for premises that could entail the hypothesis. Accuracy was determined based on if the premises in those rankings were actually the premises that entailed the hypothesis.
